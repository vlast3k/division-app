# Copilot Instructions for division-app

## Project Status

This workspace is currently empty. Once you add code to this project, these instructions should be updated with:

- **Architecture Overview**: Describe the major components and how they interact
- **Development Workflow**: Key commands for building, testing, and running the application
- **Code Conventions**: Project-specific patterns and naming conventions
- **Key Files**: Important entry points and configuration files
- **Dependencies**: External services and integration points

## Getting Started

To generate meaningful AI agent instructions for this project:

1. Add your application code
2. Run the Copilot instruction generation command again to analyze the codebase
3. Review and refine the generated instructions based on your team's needs

## Example Structure (for future reference)
